# Learning Log ðŸ“˜

This file documents my progress in learning AIops, starting with the basics of Python and moving towards more complex topics in MLOps.

## Week 1: Python Basics

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types

- **Variables**: 
  - Learned how to declare and assign values to variables.
  - Explored different types of variables: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
  - Discussed the importance of variable naming conventions for readability and maintainability.

- **Python Literals**:
  - Understood the concept of literals in Python.
  - Explored different types of literals:
    - **Numeric Literals**: Integer, Float, Complex.
    - **String Literals**: Single, Double, and Triple quotes for multi-line strings.
    - **Boolean Literals**: `True` and `False`.
    - **Special Literals**: `None`.

### Day 2: Operators in Python

- **Arithmetic Operators**:
  - Practiced using basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`.
  - Worked on examples involving complex expressions.

- **Comparison Operators**:
  - Learned about operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
  - Applied these operators in conditional statements to make decisions in code.

- **Logical Operators**:
  - Explored `and`, `or`, and `not` operators.
  - Practiced combining conditions using logical operators.

- **Assignment Operators**:
  - Understood the use of `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and other compound assignment operators.
  - Implemented examples to reinforce the concept of updating variable values.

- **Bitwise Operators**:
  - Briefly touched upon bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`.
  - Identified scenarios where these might be useful, especially in lower-level programming.

### Reflection:
Learning the basics of Python, especially variables, literals, and operators, lays a strong foundation for more advanced topics. Iâ€™m excited to continue building on this knowledge as I progress through the AIops course.
